// Playback pipeline abstraction.

// The render path has two orthogonal axes:

//   1. Engine            — MSE (with optional EME) | WebCodecs
//   2. Packaging         — cmaf | loc | locmaf | ... (per-track on the wire)
//
// Most engine/packaging combinations are valid; some require reconstruction.
// Encrypted content can only flow through the MSE engine because production
// browsers don't expose Encrypted WebCodecs.

// `MsePipeline` owns MediaSource, SourceBuffer, and (eventually) MediaKeys/EME.
// `WebCodecsLocPipeline` (Phase 3) will own VideoDecoder/AudioDecoder + canvas.
// LOCMAF lands as additional packaging support: a payload adapter that
// reconstructs CMAF for MSE and (clear-only) raw chunks for WebCodecs.
