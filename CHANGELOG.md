# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Public `Player.selectNamespace()` and a `namespace` browser URL parameter
  for orchestrators that know the catalog namespace and cannot rely on relay
  replay of earlier announcements.

- Clear LOC AV1 spatial-SVC playback. Catalog dependency chains are validated,
  all layers through the selected target are subscribed, and matching objects
  are reconstructed into one WebCodecs AV1 temporal unit using RFC 9626 frame
  markings. Dropdown quality changes now add or remove enhancement-track
  subscriptions without restarting WebCodecs. Includes strict missing-layer
  recovery and AV1 capability checks.
- Timed-text overlay seam (`src/overlay`): a snapshot timeline with `push`
  (open-ended state) and `addCue` (intervals) channels, resolved by search
  against the picture clock, plus a CTA-608 renderer that paints screens on
  the true 32x15 grid.
- `IPlaybackPipeline.getPresentationTimeMs()` — the presentation time of the
  picture on screen, implemented by both render engines.

### Fixed

- Draft-16 `SUBSCRIBE` request parameters now use the wire layout accepted by
  strict relays such as moqx. `SUBSCRIBE_ERROR` logging no longer attempts to
  JSON-encode BigInts.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-06

See the README for details on the catalog, packaging, and buffer control.

### Added

- Catalog-retrieval selector (joining | subscribe | fetch); joining FETCH default.
- Tunable per-engine/browser buffer profiles in `config.json` (`bufferProfiles`).

### Changed

- LOCMAF packaging updated to **v0.3** via the `Eyevinn/locmaf` module.
- Reworked MSE latency control (fixed-cadence loop, live-edge resync); 200/300 ms
  is stable across engines and browsers.
- A CMAF video and a LOCMAF audio may now be selected together.
- Playback starts on the minimal buffer; segment-buffer cap raised 30 → 64.
- Catalog references updated to MSF/CMSF draft-01.

### Removed

- The in-tree LOCMAF v0.2 decoder (available at the `v0.11.0` tag).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-04

MSF/CMSF catalog support updated to draft-ietf-moq-msf-01, with the new
catalog-level init data references and string version signaling.

### Changed

- Catalog parsing now follows draft-ietf-moq-msf-01:
  - `version` is a JSON string and is validated: only `"draft-01"` is
    accepted (`MSF_SUPPORTED_VERSION`); catalogs advertising any other
    version are rejected per §5.1.1
  - Initialization data lives in a catalog-level `initDataList`, and each
    track references an entry by `initRef`; a CMAF track and its LOCMAF
    counterpart share one entry. Resolve via
    `WarpCatalogManager.getInitData(track)`
  - Delta updates are an ordered `deltaUpdate` array of `{op, tracks}`
    operations
- The catalog viewer truncates the shared `initDataList` payloads for
  readability instead of the removed per-track `initData` field

### Removed

- LOCMAF v0.1 decoder and its tests; `LOCMAF_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` is now
  `{"0.2"}` and an absent `locmafVersion` is assumed to be v0.2.
  `src/locmaf/locmaf.ts` is a thin v0.2-only wrapper over
  `src/locmaf/v02/decoder.ts`

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-02

LOCMAF v0.2 wire-format support, decoded alongside v0.1 and played through
the MSE pipeline.

### Added

- LOCMAF v0.2 decoder under `src/locmaf/v02/`, selected per track via the
  catalog `locmafVersion` field
  - Version dispatch in `src/locmaf/locmaf.ts`: `LOCMAF_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS`
    now accepts both `"0.1"` and `"0.2"`, routing v0.2 tracks to the new
    decoder while v0.1 continues through the existing path
  - Shared `senc` (sample encryption) helpers in `src/locmaf/senc.ts`
    reused across versions
  - Unit tests and a test encoder for the v0.2 wire format

### Fixed

- v0.2 `moof` `track_ID` is derived from the init segment's `tkhd`,
  falling back to `trex`

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-17

LOCMAF (compressed CMAF) packaging support, decoded into CMAF and played
through the MSE pipeline.

### Added

- LOCMAF packaging support for tracks advertising `packaging: "locmaf"`
  in the CMSF catalog
  - New `src/locmaf/` module parses LOCMAF init, full `moof`, and delta
    `moof` objects per the v0.1 wire format and reconstructs standard
    CMAF init / media segments for the MSE pipeline
  - Header type values `LOCMAF_HEADER_MOOV` (21), `LOCMAF_HEADER_MOOF`
    (23), and `LOCMAF_HEADER_MOOF_DELTA` (25), with QUIC varint encoding
    for length fields
  - `baseMediaDecodeTime` is derived in delta `moof` headers; sample
    sizes are inferred when only one sample is sent per CMAF chunk
  - Receiver gated on `locmafVersion` from the catalog Track
    (`LOCMAF_SUPPORTED_VERSION = "0.1"`)
  - Engine capability matrix updated so `locmaf` routes through MSE
    alongside `cmaf`
- Test fixtures and unit tests under `test/locmaf-test-files/` and
  `src/locmaf/locmaf.test.ts`

### Changed

- MSE pipeline avoids double parsing of LOCMAF/CMAF chunks
- Test media moved to `test/media-files/`
- Bumped development dependencies (TypeScript 5.9 → 6.0,
  `@commitlint/cli` 20 → 21, `@commitlint/config-conventional`)
- Bumped production dependencies (5-update group)
- Bumped `actions/dependency-review-action` GitHub Action from 4 to 5

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-05

WebCodecs LOC playback engine alongside the existing MSE/CMAF engine.

### Added

- WebCodecs render pipeline for `packaging: "loc"` tracks
  ([draft-mzanaty-moq-loc])
  - AVC (H.264) and HEVC (H.265) video, decoded with `VideoDecoder` and
    drawn onto a canvas overlaid on the `<video>` element via a
    wallclock-anchored `requestAnimationFrame` loop
  - AAC-LC and Opus audio, decoded with `AudioDecoder` and scheduled on
    a single `AudioContext` sharing the video render loop's wallclock
    anchor for gap-free playback
  - LOC parser and decoder helpers under `src/loc/` (NALU walking,
    `AVCDecoderConfigurationRecord` / `HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord`
    builders, AAC `AudioSpecificConfig` and Opus `OpusHead` synthesis,
    LOC extension-header parsing for capture timestamps)
- Pluggable pipeline abstraction (`IPlaybackPipeline`) with capability
  matrix for (engine × packaging × encryption); `MsePipeline` and
  `WebCodecsLocPipeline` implementations under `src/pipeline/`
- "Render engine" UI selector (`Auto` / `MSE (CMAF)` / `WebCodecs (LOC)`)
  that filters the namespace selector so namespaces incompatible with
  the chosen engine dim out
- Engine legend overlay on the player surface showing active namespace,
  engine, DRM system, and selected video / audio track names
- Mute / Unmute button that drives a `GainNode` for WebCodecs and the
  `<video muted>` attribute for MSE

### Fixed

- Catalog tracks without an explicit `namespace` now inherit the
  announce namespace of the catalog track they were delivered on
- Safari no longer flags `WebTransport.closed` rejection during normal
  disconnect

### Changed

- Bumped development dependencies (@types/node, prettier, webpack)
- Bumped production dependencies (@commitlint/\*, @typescript-eslint/\*,
  globals, html-webpack-plugin, typescript-eslint)
